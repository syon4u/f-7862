            <p className="mb-4">
              Happy Kids Box was born from a desire to solve two common problems faced by parents: 
              the time-consuming nature of shopping for constantly growing children and the environmental 
              impact of fast fashion.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We started in Jamaica with a mission to provide convenient access to quality children's 
              clothing while supporting local communities and sustainable practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we're proud to offer a service that saves parents time and stress while ensuring 
              children receive clothes that are durable, comfortable, and stylish.
